# Airport2Sim
I'll be posting all of my freeware scenery here, no projects announced yet, but this GitHub will be updated when scenery is availible.
To install, just drag the folder for each scenery into the "Community" folder of your Microsoft Flight Simulator install, as I continue to make more scenery, some airports will become payware over time with updates and taken off of here once I'm satisfied, so this is more of a public free beta for payware scenery.
